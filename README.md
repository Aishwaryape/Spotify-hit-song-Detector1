# Spotify-hit-song-Detector1

Spotify music datasets from the year 1960’s to 2010 are provided. The datasets given
consist of features for tracks abstracted from Spotify web API . A classification model is
built to predict whether any given track will be labelled as ‘Hit’ or ‘Flop’ based on the
feature score. Further this deep learning web application will also assist any new artist
to compose his own new track with appropriate feature score to give a hit song based
on previous year predictions.


The dataset includes measurements for the following
features, which is defined and measured by Spotify for each track:

1. danceability

9. liveness
10.valence
11.tempo
12.duration
13.time signature
14.Chorus hit
15.Section
16.Target ( A boolean variable)
